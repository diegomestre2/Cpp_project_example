1. What is meant by the term prompt?
Output some request to the user.

2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable?
std::cin

3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named number,
what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value into your
program?
int number{0};
std::cin >> number;

4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve?
newline character and it sets the cursor in the next line.

5. What terminates input into a string?
It terminates when finds a whitespace, space, newline and tab.

6. What terminates input into an integer?
Non numeric character

7. How would you write
cout << "Hello, ";
cout << first_name;
cout << "!\n";
as a single line of code?
cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";

8. What is an object?
It is a representation of a real world object into a programming concept.

9. What is a literal?
It is a value that constant and it is supposed to be used as it is.

10. What kinds of literals are there?
Integer literals, floating-point literals, boolean literals, string literals, character literals

11. What is a variable?
It is a named addresable space  in memory where some data can be stored.

12. What are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double?
char = 1 byte int = 2 or 4  bytes and double = 8 bytes

13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?
bytes

14. What is the difference between = and ==?
= is the assigment operator and == is the iquality compare operator

15. What is a definition?
It is a pre compiled unique specification for a variable, object, function, class, enumerator.

16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?
Assigment is storing a value in the location using the assigment operator (=).
Initialization is an assigment done during the variable creation.

17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?
A string concatenation means that two or more strings are joined together as one string, one after another.
In C++ this is done with the + operator.

18. Which of the following are legal names in C++? If a name is not legal, why not?
T his_little_pig Ok
T his_1_is fine  Spaces are not allowed
2_For_1_specia l Initialize with numbers and spaces are not allowed
la test thing Spaces
the_$12_method special characters
_this_is_ok underscore in the beginning is not allowed
MiniMineMine Ok
number Ok
correct? special character is not allowed

19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldnâ€™t use because they are likely to cause
confusion.

NAME reserved for macros
Int standard does not use capital letters.
f00 easy to mistype using foo
f1 fl
Name name names
long_names_that_are_hard_to_type

20. What are some good rules for choosing names?
meaningful names.
separate words by _ "house style"
Initial capital letters for defined types Class...

21. What is type safety and why is it important?
It's the ability of the compiler to define the type of a variable during compilation and they are used according to the rules of their type.

22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?
Because you may lose precision.

23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.
A convertion is safe when the convertion from type a to b allows the convertion back to a wihtout losing precision.
